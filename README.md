Tutorial on how to run this project;

Note that the Postgres database is down (because the paid subscription has ended) and thus the backend currently cannot function.

1. Download the project

2. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and type "cd ConservationApp/frontend", hit enter.

3. Then, type "yarn dev", hit enter. You will be prompted to go to http://localhost:3000/ which is the user entrypoint to add, delete, and query for results from the database.

4. If the database ever comes back online, open another terminal in the project's root directory and type "cd ConservationApp/backend", hit enter. Then type "yarn start" and hit enter. This will run the backend of this project.
